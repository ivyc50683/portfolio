            Hi I am Ivy. Currently a Master's student at UCL studying Cognitive
            and Decision Science, learning about Python, computational
            linguistic, computational modelling of cognition, and psychology. My
            research focuses on perception, memory formation, and NLP memory
            modeling. <br /><br />
            Before my Master's, I spent 6 years as a UX Researcher, Designer,
            and Product Owner in startups, building products from scratch,
            including a navigation app for individuals with visual impairment.

              <!-- Research Findings -->
              <p class="section-description">
                During interviews with participants who are blind, our research
                has uncovered a remarkable phenomenon - their extraordinary
                prowess in other senses, particularly hearing and touch, which
                they described as transformative experiences that reshaped their
                perception. <br /><br />
                These heightened senses become their tools for navigation and
                spatial perception. For instance, they adeptly determine
                building exits or entrances by feeling the direction of air and
                wind on their face or body (although the compulsory use of masks
                during the pandemic has made this more challenging). They rely
                on the feedback from the knocks of their poles to gauge the
                distance of potential obstacles. Tiles on the floor emerge as
                the most reliable navigation cues, prompting blind individuals
                to actively seek them out in indoor spaces.<br /><br />
                In contrast, individuals with low vision, including those with
                tunnel vision or severe nearsightedness, predominantly rely on
                sight as their primary navigation tool. Surprisingly, none of
                them use accessibility features such as Voice Over or Talkback.
                When faced with unfamiliar indoor spaces, they still prefer to
                view maps with the assistance of magnifiers, whether digital or
                physical. Although vision remains their primary navigation tool,
                they have specific preferences for the user interface and screen
                display due to the challenges they face. For instance, they find
                black text on a white background to have excessive contrast,
                making reading more difficult and strenuous. They prefer a
                minimum font size of around 16px for comfortable reading, among
                other considerations.<br /><br />

                Armed with these invaluable insights, we have successfully
                translated them into our design approach, ensuring that our

                Providing effective navigation guidance to individuals who are
                blind or have low vision presents significant challenges due to
                the difficulties in accurately conveying spatial information
                through limited words or sound cues. We have designed what we
                call the "sound beacon", a sound guidance for visually impaired
                users to follow during navigation.<br /><br />
              </p>

              <p class="section-description">
                For users with low vision, we have carefully designed the user
                interface with a black background and yellow text. Although this
                colour combination may have lower contrast, it remains readable,
                ensuring effortless reading. We have set the smallest font size
                to 16px to enhance legibility. Furthermore, we have minimised
                the use of text for conveying important messages, including
                navigation directions. Instead, we rely on large icons and
                animations for clear communication. During navigation, we have
                developed prominent direction animations that occupy a
                significant portion of the screen. This empowers low vision
                users to accurately interpret meanings, such as directions,
                without relying solely on reading text.<br /><br />
                By addressing these considerations in our design approach, we
                aim to enhance navigation accessibility and provide a
                user-friendly experience for individuals with visual
                impairments.<br />

                In our user research for Indoor Map, we discovered that
                participants rely on map apps like Google Maps when navigating
                unfamiliar outdoor environments. However, when it comes to
                indoor spaces, they tend to turn to static indoor maps or seek
                assistance from customer service centers. As our discussions
                progressed, participants expressed a strong desire for an
                interactive indoor map that offers real-time guidance and
                facilitates exploration within intricate indoor environments.<br /><br />
                An interactive indoor map provides a visual representation of
                the indoor space, allowing participants to easily locate
                specific places, amenities, or points of interest. This saves
                them time and improves efficiency in unfamiliar surroundings.
                Additionally, it offers a sense of orientation and contextual
                awareness, empowering participants to make informed decisions
                and navigate confidently.<br /><br />
                Also, by including features such as wheelchair-accessible
                routes, an interactive indoor map ensures that everyone can
                navigate the indoor space comfortably and independently.
                Supporting users to discover points of interest (restaurants,
                shops, or services), that they may not have been aware of
                otherwise.<br /><br />

                Equipped with user insights, my role was to create the user
                experience, ensuring that interactions with the sophisticated
                technology of Indoor Map felt effortless and enjoyable.<br /><br />
                I also took the chance to understand how navigation was
                calculated technically. At the heart of Mapxus's Indoor
                Positioning System (IPS) lies Wi-Fi fingerprinting, a technology
                that analyses the distinctive signal patterns emitted by fixed
                Wi-Fi access points (AP) within a building, providing precise
                indoor positioning. To further enhance accuracy, Indoor Map also
                integrates Pedestrians Dead Reckoning (PDR) technology, which
                considers factors like orientation and step length to calculate
                displacement. These advancements form the core of Indoor Map,
                ensuring its reliability and precision as a transformative
                navigation tool for indoor spaces.<br /><br />
                Given the powerful technology, numerous interactions are
                available but could be overwhelming to users. Hence, I placed a
                strong emphasis on minimising cognitive load during the design
                process. This involved presenting information in a clear and
                concise manner, using familiar visual cues and affordances that
                users are accustomed to, and streamlining the number of steps
                required to complete tasks within the map.<br /><br />

                It is worth mentioning that we have designed different route
                navigation experience on mobile and desktop, based on the
                assumption that users are less likely to navigate using a
                desktop and more likely to use a mobile device. Therefore, on
                the desktop version, we designed a QR code for users to scan
                with their mobile devices, allowing them to have the interactive
                map readily available on a conveniently portable device.<br /><br />

                The research highlighted several key insights regarding parents'
                decision-making in STEM education for young children.<br /><br />
                Parents of 3-4-year-olds understand the importance of early
                exposure and aim to provide their children with diverse
                experiences. However, parents in Hong Kong face challenges
                selecting STEM courses due to the saturation of the market with
                many providers. They often rely on recommendations from friends
                and family due to information overload.<br /><br />
                Another hurdle for parents is their knowledge gap in STEM
                subjects. Many parents do not feel well-versed in STEM, so they
                rely on their child's response and the teacher's engagement when
                evaluating education providers.<br /><br />
                Parents' expectations for children's engagement with STEM vary
                by age. For children aged 3-7, parents do not expect
                memorization or deep interest in STEM. But as children reach 7,
                parents expect technical knowledge and the ability to recall key
                concepts. A failure to do so may signal low-quality
                education.<br /><br />
                Motivation to refer providers comes from the belief that
                studying with friends enhances the learning experience, and
                positive referrals strengthen parent networking as social
                contracts.

                Clara is a mental wellness app for Neurum Health, dedicated to
                enhancing personal connections and promoting well-being
                utilizing the power of technology and artificial
                intelligence.<br /><br />
                The company was in the early stages of building the product, and
                my primary role was to gain insights into how people,
                particularly in the Asian context, perceive and engage with
                digital mental health support.<br /><br />

              <!-- Low User Engagement -->
              <h3 class="section-title">LOW USER ENGAGEMENT</h3>
              <p class="section-description">
                Despite Clara's impressive technology capabilities, user
                engagement appears to be lacking. User engagement plays a
                crucial role in ensuring accurate health data and effective
                content suggestions, as it relies on users actively logging
                their daily activities and emotions.<br /><br />
                Data revealed that the day 1 retention rate stands at a mere
                2.4%, with the bi-weekly retention rate dipping below 2%.
                Consequently, the founders have sought assistance in finding
                solutions to enhance user engagement.

              <p class="section-description">
                Through our interviews with 17 users, we gained valuable
                insights that went beyond the realm of app design, providing us
                with a comprehensive understanding of well-being applications
                and how they are perceived.<br /><br />
                First, the interviews shed light on the perceived value of using
                Clara. Users expressed their expectations of receiving
                personalised well-being recommendations, data-driven insights,
                and improved mental health outcomes. However, it was mentioned
                that privacy concerns acted as a significant barrier to
                continuous usage of mental health apps, as Clara was introduced
                to them through their employer, which was the business strategy
                Clara took on.<br /><br />
                Furthermore, I delved into users' experiences with other
                well-being apps and their interactions with them. Users shared
                their positive experiences and highlighted the aspects that
                worked well for them, but they also discussed the challenges
                they faced. Interestingly, some users mentioned feeling more
                comfortable sharing their deepest emotions, including thoughts
                of suicide, with a non-human recipient. This insight revealed
                that the absence of a human response didn't deter them from
                using the app; rather, it provided a sense of objectivity.
                Nonetheless, some users expressed a desire for Clara to provide
                warm and considerate conversations that mimic human interaction,
                as they hoped to feel heard during their interactions.<br /><br />
                Moreover, the interviews uncovered important user needs and
                goals. Users expressed a desire for features that could
                effectively address their specific well-being concerns, such as
                stress management techniques, mindfulness exercises, and goal
                tracking functionalities. Understanding these needs allowed us
                to prioritise feature development in a way that aligned with
                user expectations and greatly enhanced the overall user
                experience.

              <p class="section-description">
                We were able to finalise the app's design in just one month.
                Following that, we transitioned into the development phase. The
                focused efforts and efficient collaboration allowed us to launch
                Clara within a mere three-month timeframe.<br /><br />
                Following the revamp, we witnessed a significant increase in
                user engagement metrics. On day 1, the retention rate
                skyrocketed from a mere 2% to an impressive 46%. Furthermore,
                the bi-weekly retention rate, which previously stood at less
                than 2%, surged to a noteworthy 18%. These figures clearly
                indicate a substantial improvement in user interest and
                commitment.<br /><br />
                In terms of usage patterns, users now access Clara an average of
                three times per week, demonstrating a higher level of
                interaction and involvement. Moreover, the average time spent on
                the app has also risen, with users now dedicating more than 15
                minutes per session. These statistics highlight the app's
                ability to captivate and retain user attention.<br /><br />
                Additionally, the revamped Clara app has successfully encouraged
                user participation in various activities. Over 60% of users
                actively log their daily activities on the app, indicating
                strong engagement with the tracking features. Furthermore, more
                than 80% of users actively consume the content available on the
                app, using it as a valuable resource for obtaining new
                knowledge.

                boosting sales, and fostering customer loyalty, we conceived the
