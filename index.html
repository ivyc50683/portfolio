        <p>
            Currently a Master‚Äôs student at UCL studying Cognitive and Decision Science, my research focuses on perception, memory formation, and NLP memory modeling under Dr. Avital Hahamy's supervision. I am also involved in developing LiveSign at UCL AI Foundry Cohort 3 and volunteering with Project Impactive to design assistive technology. <br><br>
            Before my Master‚Äôs, I spent 6 years as a UX Researcher, Designer, and Product Owner in startups, building products from inception, including a navigation app for individuals with visual impairment.
