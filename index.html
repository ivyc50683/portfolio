                    Imagine yourself in a vast, unfamiliar indoor complex, enveloped in complete darkness. How would you explore the space or find your way to a specific location? Citygeni is an assessible indoor map for Mapxus, designed browsing and navigation experience for individuals with visual impairments.I conducted research with participants across the visual impairment spectrum, gaining insights on how spatial perception is formed and used. Additionally, I contributed to the review of UI design, ensuring insights are skilfully transformed into functional features that bring the joy of exploration to life.<br><br>
                  </p>                  
                  <img src="https://github.com/ivyc50683/portfolio/blob/main/assets/accessible_2.png?raw=true"

                  <p>
                    During interviews with participants who are blind, our research has uncovered a remarkable phenomenon - their extraordinary prowess in other senses, particularly hearing and touch, which they described as transformative experiences that reshaped their perception. <br><br>
                    These heightened senses become their tools for navigation and spatial perception. For instance, they adeptly determine building exits or entrances by feeling the direction of air and wind on their face or body (although the compulsory use of masks during the pandemic has made this more challenging). They rely on the feedback from the knocks of their poles to gauge the distance of potential obstacles. Tiles on the floor emerge as the most reliable navigation cues, prompting blind individuals to actively seek them out in indoor spaces.<br><br>
                    In contrast, individuals with low vision, including those with tunnel vision or severe nearsightedness, predominantly rely on sight as their primary navigation tool. Surprisingly, none of them use accessibility features such as Voice Over or Talkback. When faced with unfamiliar indoor spaces, they still prefer to view maps with the assistance of magnifiers, whether digital or physical. Although vision remains their primary navigation tool, they have specific preferences for the user interface and screen display due to the challenges they face. For instance, they find black text on a white background to have excessive contrast, making reading more difficult and strenuous. They prefer a minimum font size of around 16px for comfortable reading, among other considerations.<br><br>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Armed with these invaluable insights, we have successfully translated them into our design approach, ensuring that our product caters to the unique needs and preferences of individuals who are completely blind or have low vision.<br>

                  <p>
                    Providing effective navigation guidance to individuals who are blind or have low vision presents significant challenges due to the difficulties in accurately conveying spatial information through limited words or sound cues. We have designed what we call the "sound beacon", a sound guidance for visually impaired users to follow during navigation.<br><br>
                  </p> 
                  <img src="https://github.com/ivyc50683/portfolio/blob/main/assets/accessible_5.gif?raw=true" 
                       alt="Detailed view of Accessible Indoor Map App feature" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"><br><br>
                  <p>
                    For users with low vision, we have carefully designed the user interface with a black background and yellow text. Although this colour combination may have lower contrast, it remains readable, ensuring effortless reading. We have set the smallest font size to 16px to enhance legibility. Furthermore, we have minimised the use of text for conveying important messages, including navigation directions. Instead, we rely on large icons and animations for clear communication. During navigation, we have developed prominent direction animations that occupy a significant portion of the screen. This empowers low vision users to accurately interpret meanings, such as directions, without relying solely on reading text.<br><br>
                    By addressing these considerations in our design approach, we aim to enhance navigation accessibility and provide a user-friendly experience for individuals with visual impairments.<br>

                    RESEARCH<br>
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    In our user research for Indoor Map, we discovered that participants rely on map apps like Google Maps when navigating unfamiliar outdoor environments. However, when it comes to indoor spaces, they tend to turn to static indoor maps or seek assistance from customer service centers. As our discussions progressed, participants expressed a strong desire for an interactive indoor map that offers real-time guidance and facilitates exploration within intricate indoor environments.<br><br>
                    An interactive indoor map provides a visual representation of the indoor space, allowing participants to easily locate specific places, amenities, or points of interest. This saves them time and improves efficiency in unfamiliar surroundings. Additionally, it offers a sense of orientation and contextual awareness, empowering participants to make informed decisions and navigate confidently.<br><br>
                    Also, by including features such as wheelchair-accessible routes, an interactive indoor map ensures that everyone can navigate the indoor space comfortably and independently. Supporting users to discover points of interest (restaurants, shops, or services), that they may not have been aware of otherwise.<br><br>

                    DESIGN<br>
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Equipped with user insights, my role was to create the user experience, ensuring that interactions with the sophisticated technology of Indoor Map felt effortless and enjoyable.<br><br>
                    I also took the chance to understand how navigation was calculated technically. At the heart of Mapxus's Indoor Positioning System (IPS) lies Wi-Fi fingerprinting, a technology that analyses the distinctive signal patterns emitted by fixed Wi-Fi access points (AP) within a building, providing precise indoor positioning. To further enhance accuracy, Indoor Map also integrates Pedestrians Dead Reckoning (PDR) technology, which considers factors like orientation and step length to calculate displacement. These advancements form the core of Indoor Map, ensuring its reliability and precision as a transformative navigation tool for indoor spaces.<br><br>
                    Given the powerful technology, numerous interactions are available but could be overwhelming to users. Hence, I placed a strong emphasis on minimising cognitive load during the design process. This involved presenting information in a clear and concise manner, using familiar visual cues and affordances that users are accustomed to, and streamlining the number of steps required to complete tasks within the map.<br><br>
                  </p>
                  <img src="https://github.com/ivyc50683/portfolio/blob/main/assets/indoor_3.png?raw=true"

                  <p>
                    It is worth mentioned that we have designed different route navigation experience on mobile and desktop, based on the assumption that users are less likely to navigate using a desktop and more likely to use a mobile device. Therefore, on the desktop version, we designed a QR code for users to scan with their mobile devices, allowing them to have the interactive map readily available on a conveniently portable device.<br><br>

                    Digital map production is at the core of Mapxus's indoor mapping operations. However, the map accuracy can be compromised over time, particularly when venues undergo changes in their layout or structure. As a result, validating the digital maps has become an essential component of the quality assurance process. Data accuracy is particularly important as Mapxus is a <a href="https://register.apple.com/resources/indoor/program/faq" target="_blank">recognised Apple indoor map data provider</a>.<br><br>
                    In addition to the primary goal of maintaining accuracy, visiting venues to validate the digital maps offers a valuable opportunity to gather information that may not be included in the original floor plan. This includes crucial details like shop names, photos of shop fronts, opening hours and more. Such information plays a vital role in enabling end users to navigate efficiently within large and complex indoor spaces.<br><br>
                    As the UX Researcher and Designer, I conducted research regarding the map production process, designed the site validation app from scratch, and revamp the map production workflow.<br><br>

                    To create a tool to be used in map validation process, I conducted research with various stakeholders, including map production teams (Hong Kong and Taiwan), map validation teams (Hong Kong and Japan), product director and business director. Since Mapxus is an Apple indoor map data provider, I also studied the <a href="https://register.apple.com/resources/imdf/" target="_blank"> Apple Indoor Mapping Data Format (IMDF) standard</a> to incorporate IMDF requirements into the tool's design to provide accurate and reliable indoor mapping data. I also gathered feedback from general users to understand their needs and expectations when navigating in large indoor spaces.

                    I gathered and consolidated key insights to create a journey map, encompassed various aspects that were crucial for improving our map production and validation process.<br><br>
                    During the research process, I gained important insights that shaped our approach. To name a few, map validation team hoped to have explicit instructions on what to capture during site validation and the desired level of notes. This clarity enabled our map production team to make accurate modifications based on the feedback received.<br><br>
                    Transparency between the map production and validation teams was identified as critical. It allowed them to effectively allocate resources for venue visits and make timely adjustments to the maps for project delivery.<br><br>
                    Streamlining the approval process was also important. I found that that not all map changes required approval from the map production team, which was a project delivery blocker given the amount of changes that needs to be reviewed. Simplifying this process would enhance efficiency within the workflow.<br><br>
                    To optimise the time-consuming map validation process, we identified the need for efficient validation tools that minimised clicks, facilitated easy note-taking, and enabled seamless reporting.<br><br>
                    Additionally, stakeholders mentioned that the map validation process is an opportunity to build trust with venue owners, showcase our technical expertise, and potentially involve partners in contributing to map accuracy and data management. This could open doors for generating revenue through collaborations.<br><br>
                    Insights from conversations with general users revealed their preferences for shop photos, opening hours, and phone numbers on digital maps. Balancing efficiency in the validation process while providing an enhanced user experience became a priority for us.<br><br>
                    Leveraging these valuable insights, I took on the responsibility of designing a tool that would meet the needs of all stakeholders involved in the validation process of our digital maps.<br><br>
                  </p>
                  <h3>
                    DESIGN<br> 
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    In response to the need for detailed feedback for accuracy and guidance for the validation perspective, I have designed a system of 7 types of remarks (and growing). These remarks serve as specific aspects that the map validation team should consider while visiting venues to validate the digital map.<br><br>
                  </p>
                  <img src="https://github.com/ivyc50683/portfolio/blob/main/assets/production_3.png?raw=true" 
                       alt="Detailed view of Map Production App feature" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"><br><br>
                  <p>
                    To address the requirement for efficient validation tools, I have ensured that all remarks can be completed in just three clicks. The process involves adding a pin on the map, filling in the required notes, and submitting the remark. *The actual number of clicks may vary depending on the specific remark type.<br><br>
                    To enhance progress transparency, I have designed a "remark board" and progress chart where the map validation team can track the progress of their submitted remarks.<br><br>
                    To meet Apple's requirements while also providing important details desired by the general public, I have created a POI details page for the map validation team to collect essential information about each venue and their POIs.<br><br>
                  </p>
                  <img src="https://github.com/ivyc50683/portfolio/blob/main/assets/production_4.png?raw=true" 
                       alt="Detailed view of Map Production App feature" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"><br><br>
                  <p>
                    The app was also designed to provide real-time updates. Any changes made by our map validation team to a POI are immediately reflected in our database and on the map, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information. To support the map validation process, I have developed an interface specifically designed for the map production team. This interface enables them to efficiently process remarks and handle any necessary structural changes.<br><br>
                  </p>
                  <img src="https://github.com/ivyc50683/portfolio/blob/main/assets/production_5.png?raw=true" 
                       alt="Detailed view of Map Production App feature" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"><br><br>
                  <p>
                    To address responsibility delegation, I have proposed a workflow that reallocates responsibilities, unblocking the map validation team and creating opportunities for building trust and demonstrating expertise. In this workflow, the map validation team assumes full ownership of the map data, with all changes made updating our database and reflecting on the map in real time. The map production team's role is focused solely on handling remarks that require structural changes.<br><br>
                    To facilitate continuous growth and development, a map validation report has been designed. This report serves as a tool for retrospective analysis for both teams, allowing them to identify areas for improvement and drive future enhancements.<br><br>
                  </p>
                  <img src="https://github.com/ivyc50683/portfolio/blob/main/assets/production_6.png?raw=true"

                  <p>
                    As the tool aims to serve 100+ staff across 5 cities worldwide, to support the launch, I created a user manual that was translated to cater to our local partners in these regions. The manual provides detailed instructions on how to use the tool, ensuring a smooth transition for all users.<br><br>

                  <p> 
                    The new app was successfully launched in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan in the first phase.<br><br>
                    To ensure a smooth adoption of the app and workflow, I was flew to Japan to provide training and observe users utilising the new features. Following the launch, I conducted feedback sessions with the map production team, map validation team, and stakeholders to gather feedback for further iterations.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The feedback revealed significant improvements in efficiency and productivity for our map production team. They reported a remarkable 70% reduction in their workload since the implementation of the new app and workflow.<br><br>
                    This positive change has allowed them to work more efficiently and effectively. The map validation team expressed higher job satisfaction as the app empowered them to ensure better map quality for venue owners. With the new tools and workflow, they were able to provide accurate and reliable maps, which boosted confidence among our local partners. The team felt empowered and valued in their role.<br><br>
                    Both the map production and validation teams found the validation report to be extremely valuable. The report served as a solid foundation for discussions and collaboration, enabling them to align expectations and work more effectively. It provided a comprehensive overview of the validation process, highlighting areas of improvement and success.<br><br>
                    Stakeholders, including venue owners and local partners, expressed satisfaction with the optimised flow. They recognised the changes strengthened relationships and opened up new business opportunities. The improved map quality and efficient validation process enhanced their trust in our services.<br><br>
                    Furthermore, Mapxus stakeholders recognised the potential to expand the app and workflow to untapped markets, such as Korea. They acknowledged the value it can bring to those regions, paving the way for future growth and opportunities.

                    I conducted in-depth interviews with 12 participants including parents, education psychologist, and teachers to understand expectations in selecting ed-tech services or products. The interviews were conducted in Cantonese (5 interviews), English (4 interviews), and Mandarin (3 interview), reflecting the diversity of the company's target audience.<br><br>
                    During the interviews, various aspects of STEM courses were discussed. Topics included the criteria adopted when comparing STEM courses in the market, parents' understanding and perception of STEM courses, and their expectations regarding the outcomes of these courses for their children aged 3-12.<br><br>
                    School teachers and educational psychologists were also consulted to gather their perspectives on what constitutes a good STEM course for young children.<br><br>
                    To effectively communicate the research findings to the team, a one-pager was created. This summary provided a comprehensive overview of the key findings and recommendations.<br><br>

                  <p>
                    The research findings highlight several key insights regarding parents' decision-making processes in relation to STEM education for young children.<br><br>
                    Parents of 3-4-year-olds understand the importance of early exposure and strive to provide their children with a diverse range of experiences. They believe that this exposure will ignite their child's interest in various areas, nurturing their curiosity and potential.<br><br>
                    However, parents in Hong Kong face challenges when it comes to selecting STEM courses for their children. The market is saturated with numerous providers, which can be overwhelming and confusing. Faced with information overload, parents often rely on recommendations from friends and family as a convenient shortcut to make decisions.<br><br>
                    One significant hurdle for parents is their own knowledge gap in STEM subjects. Many parents do not consider themselves well-versed in these areas. As a result, parents often rely on their child's response and their observations of the teacher's ability to engage students when evaluating education providers.<br><br>
                    Parents' expectations regarding their children's engagement with STEM subjects vary depending on their age. For children aged 3-7, parents generally do not expect them to memorise specific concepts or develop a specific interest in STEM. However, as children reach the age of 7, parents begin to anticipate their acquisition of technical knowledge and the ability to recall key concepts from their classes. Failing to do so might indicate the quality of the education provider.<br><br>
                    Motivation to refer education providers arises from the belief that it will enhance their own child's learning experience if they get to study with their friends. Referrals also serve to strengthen parent networking, as positive referrals are viewed as positive social contracts.

                  <p>
                    First, the interviews shed light on the perceived value of using Clara. Users expressed their expectations of receiving personalised well-being recommendations, data-driven insights, and improved mental health outcomes. However, it was mentioned that privacy concerns acted as a significant barrier to continuous usage of mental health apps as Clara was introduced to them through employer, which was the business strategy Clara took on.<br><br>
                    Furthermore, I delved into users' experiences with other well-being apps and their interactions with them. Users shared their positive experiences and highlighted the aspects that worked well for them, but they also discussed the challenges they faced. Interestingly, some users mentioned feeling more comfortable sharing their deepest emotions, including thoughts of suicide, with a non-human recipient. This insight revealed that the absence of a human response didn't deter them from using the app; rather, it provided a sense of objectivity. Nonetheless, some users expressed a desire for Clara to provide warm and considerate conversations that mimic human interaction, as they hoped to feel heard during their interactions.<br><br>
                    Moreover, the interviews uncovered important user needs and goals. Users expressed a desire for features that could effectively address their specific well-being concerns, such as stress management techniques, mindfulness exercises, and goal tracking functionalities. Understanding these needs allowed us to prioritise feature development in a way that aligned with user expectations and greatly enhanced the overall user experience.

                  <p>
                    We were able to finalise the app's design in just one month. Following that, we transitioned into the development phase. The focused efforts and efficient collaboration allowed us to launch Clara within a mere three-month timeframe.<br><br>
                    Following the revamp, we witnessed a significant increase in user engagement metrics. On day 1, the retention rate skyrocketed from a mere 2% to an impressive 46%. Furthermore, the bi-weekly retention rate, which previously stood at less than 2%, surged to a noteworthy 18%. These figures clearly indicate a substantial improvement in user interest and commitment.<br><br>
                    In terms of usage patterns, users now access Clara an average of three times per week, demonstrating a higher level of interaction and involvement. Moreover, the average time spent on the app has also risen, with users now dedicating more than 15 minutes per session. These statistics highlight the app's ability to captivate and retain user attention.<br><br>
                    Additionally, the revamped Clara app has successfully encouraged user participation in various activities. Over 60% of users actively log their daily activities on the app, indicating a strong engagement with the tracking features. Furthermore, more than 80% of users actively consume the content available on the app, using it as a valuable resource for obtaining new knowledge.

Recognising the app's role in driving engagement, boosting sales, and fostering customer loyalty, we conceived the idea of a dynamic content hub‚Äîa centralised platform designed to captivate and interact with users.

                    Drawing from the feedback gathered, we crafted two distinct UI designs prototypes. Seeking real-time feedback from 10 mall visitors in the food court. We delved into their K11 membership, app awareness, and motivations for visiting, while eagerly gathering feedback as they explored both the existing app and our prototypes.<br><br>
                    Leveraging the insights gained from user testing, we crafted a solution that resonated with our users and project objectives.

                  <p>
                    In just 1 month of an intensive design sprint, we finalised the app's design and handed over the development phase to developers. As a result, the K11 app was successfully launched in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.k11.membership&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1" target="_blank">Google Play</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/hk/app/k11-hk/id920299203?l=en-GB" target="_blank">App Store</a> within a 3-month timeframe.
